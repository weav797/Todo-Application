# Todo-Application
This application is a simple todo list that displays all the information to the user on an HTML page instead of the console.
Please be aware that when you change a todo element, it counts the todo items starting at 0. 
Same applies for when you toggle an item completed.
Also, a delete button will be generated on the same line as the todo item itself.

Live demo of this application can be found on the following website:
